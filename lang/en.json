Two or three types of companion cannot be generated at the same time during the same scene or conflict phase, as only one type can exist at a time. When the knight generates a companion, he deploys nanomachines from the palm of his gauntlet, which materialize into one or more robotic allies.\r\nEach type of companion lasts for the duration of a scene or conflict phase. To extend the “life” of a companion type into the next scene or conflict phase, the knight must spend half the EP he would normally spend. Activation costs 6 seconds, or one full turn. Deactivating a companion costs neither SP nor action.\r\nIf a knight wishes to change companion type when one is already present, he must again pay the normal EP cost and use the mod's standard activation. The current companion falls to nanomachine slag, while a new one is created, with its AP and EP at maximum.\r\nIn all cases, if the AP (or cohesion) of the companion type created drops to zero, it is destroyed. A new type of companion can be created at normal energy cost.\r\nThe _ignore armor_ effect has no effect on the companion's AP; damage is applied as normal. It also ignores all _domination_ and _fear X_ abilities.\r\nCompanions can never be further away from the wearer of the Druid meta armour than the long range. If a companion exceeds this distance, it falls into nano-machine slag and is considered destroyed.\r\nCompanions act on their _initiative_, the knight needs no action to make them act.Finally, companions can receive the benefits brought by nodes and any appropriate abilities. Their EP recharge in the same way as those of knights, and they can recover AP by being repaired, thanks to abilities or nodes.\r\n**Companion generation**\r\nWhen the knight creates a companion type, he must decide to grant it a minimum of EP from his own energy core. To do this, he must choose to temporarily lower his total of EP by 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 points. His current EP are reduced by the number of total of EP sacrificed. Please note that a knight cannot sacrifice more of his total EP than he has in his current score.\r\nThese points are sacrificed for as long as the companion type is present, and form the companion's EP total as well as its current EP. To use its modules, the companion type will have to spend these EP.\r\nWhen the companion is destroyed or disappears, the knight recovers his total EP, and his current EP is increased to the level the companion had when it was destroyed.",

Should anything prevent the meta armour and its wearer from returning to their previous position, they simply move as close as possible to that position without colliding with it.\r\nThe knight must activate it on his turn in combat.

In game terms, a totem is simply destroyed by an attack that targets it (attacks that target it automatically hit, as a totem does not defend itself). The knight can use his totems to add one of his additional characteristics per totem, without overdrives, to a test he makes. As with mutual aid, the characteristics must be different each time.

During character creation, the player chooses the 3 stances their Warrior armour has installed.\r\nWhen a stance is activated, the overdrives it grants are added to any other overdrives already purchased by its wearer (including the 4 starting ODs). These additional overdrives give all the bonuses (automatic successes and special abilities) of regular overdrives. Overdrives are capped at 5 levels each, but stance ODs can add to this amount and potentially exceed 5. This means that a Knight with enough ODs in a characteristic with that characteristic’s stance active could possibly reach 6 ODs or more (this can only occur when a considerable amount of GP has been earned).\r\nOnly one stance can be active at a time, and activating a stance takes one move action. The stance activates on that move action and lasts until the character’s next turn. A stance’s duration can be prolonged by spending additional EP. This does not cost another move action. Stances cannot be changed more than once per turn, no matter how many move actions the Warrior has at its disposal (or once stance activation no longer requires an action).",

When activated, crackling tendrils of coloured light appear around the affected armour.\r\n\r\nActivating a pulse costs a move action. Pulses can be activated at extreme range, targeting any allied Knight, even if they are invisible or the Warmaster has no line of sight to them.\r\nThe Warmaster can target itself with most pulses. If targeting one or more allies, the Warmaster can choose to gain the pulse’s bonus as well for an additional energy cost specified in each pulse. Targeting more than one ally and targeting itself does not require spending any additional actions beyond the base activation cost.\r\n\r\nSome pulses can be extended by spending EP equal to half the initial activation cost, rounded up (with a minimum of 1 EP / turn). Each turn, the Warmaster decides whether to prolong a pulse effect. If they do choose to prolong it, the corresponding EP must be spent, otherwise the effect stops immediately. Paying this upkeep does not require an action. Several different pulses can affect and be prolonged on a single target, but no armour can have more than one of the same pulse active at a time.\r\nExample: _Mike’s character uses a dodge pulse on an ally. The base cost is 3 EP and a move action. Mike decides to use it on his own character as well. He spends an additional 2 EP, half of 3 rounded up, and gains the pulse’s bonus. The whole action costs a total of 5 EP and one move action. If Mike wishes to extend it when his next turn arrives, he will have to spend a further 3 EP, but no action._",
